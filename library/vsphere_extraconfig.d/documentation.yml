  - This Change VMX settings on a guest on VMWare vSphere
  - This module requires the pysphere python module.

version_added: "1.4"
author: Thierry Delamare

notes:

  - This module ought to be run from a system that can access vSphere
    directly.  Either by using local_action, or using delegate_to.

  - I assemble this before M(vsphere_guest) was available.

  - Turned out that as by 1.9.1 C(vm_extra_config) do not work with
    C(reconfigured).

  - Alias similar to M(vsphere_guest) added.
